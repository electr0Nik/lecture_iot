Simple IOT Project with Ionic, Gradle and Java


# Build

## Gradle
We're going to use Gradle to build the Project. You don't have to install Gradle. You can use the wrapper to execute the tasks.

### Gradle Wrapper Usage
You can execute a Task with the gradle wrapper using following command in your command window (Windows) or bash (*unix)
* on windows: ```gradlew.bat [task]``` replace _task_ with the Task you want to execute
* on *unix: ```./gradlew [task]```
